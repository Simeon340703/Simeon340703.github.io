        <h3>SmRNet: Scalable Multiresolution Feature Extraction Network</h3>

      <p><strong>Simegnew Alaba </strong>, John E. Ball</p>
      <p><em>IEEE ICECET, Cape Town-South Africa, November 16-17</em>, 2023 (Accepted)</p>
      <p>This work addresses the challenge of creating a lightweight CNN with high accuracy. It replaces pooling and 
      stride operations with discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and inverse wavelet transform (IWT) as downsampling 
      and upsampling operators. This preserves lost details during downsampling, leveraging wavelets' lossless property.</p>

           <p><em>IEEE Ocean Conference & Exposition, Biloxi, MS, USA, September 25--28</em> , 2023</p>
            <p>Utilizing Zero-Shot Detection for Fish Species Recognition (ZSD-FR) in underwater environments, this approach can  identify and locate objects, even for classes not seen during training.
		      Generative models, like GANs, generate samples for unseen classes by leveraging semantics learned from seen classes. </p>

          <p>Automated deep-learning models offer efficient fish population monitoring in baited underwater video sampling.
		      Precise results are essential, and otolith age-reader comparison helps evaluate model performance. 
		      Increasing annotations improve most species' performance, but challenges remain with occlusion, turbidity, 
		      schooling species, and cryptic appearances. Red Snapper's multiple-year evaluation highlights location, time, 
		      and environmental considerations. Adapting active learning algorithms can enhance model efficiency. 
		      These quality assessment methods aid in integrating automated methods with manual video counts. </p>
